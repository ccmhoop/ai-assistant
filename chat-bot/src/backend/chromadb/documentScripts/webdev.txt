We met Christopher Heaney and Liam Woulfe from Webdev Builders through a networking group. They have redesigned our website for us and they are managing our Google Analytics for us at Springfort Hall Hotel on an ongoing basis. They have a keen eye for design and they gave 100% to our project at Springfort Hall Hotel.  We are delighted with their service . Thank you to all the team at Webdev Builders.

I would highly recommend WebDevBuilders as they offered a very professional, friendly approach when designing our website.  Any changes that were needed or if there were things that needed to be added in, they were very accommodating and understood exactly what we needed.  Thank you, Fiona (GlasAir Ltd).

We contacted WebDevBuilders when we were looking for website design in Limerick, Ireland. Chris and the team were extremely helpful. They took the time to listen to what we wanted and delivered it in a timely and efficient manner. We loved the live development area where we could view the website as it was being built and suggest any adjustments. WebDevBuilders made sure we were hosted on our own server which meant our website was more secure and less likely to crash or be hacked. Chris made sure we were fully happy with everything before putting the website live and even changed one or two small things a week later. We would recommend WebDevBuilders to anyone looking for website design in Limerick, Munster or across Ireland.

I used the services of Chris and the team at WebDevBuilders Ltd in Limerick on the creation and design of a document. Their website design is top class and I look forward to availing of this further. They could not have been more helpful and their expertise and knowledge were top class. I am incredibly grateful for their assistance, am delighted with the end product and would have no hesitation in recommending their services.

Project Terms & Conditions:

WebDevBuilders Ltd operates a fixed pricing strategy. This means that edits/changes may be requested until the client is satisfied with the project. This strategy is subject to a policy of fair usage, meaning that an unreasonable number of revisions cannot be made without an additional cost added to the clients invoice. Our fair usage policy enables clients to request up to 8 edits/changes to their project, with edits thereafter charged at €250 per edit. WebDevBuilders Ltd fixed pricing strategy applies to edits only, and not reshoots.

WebDevBuilders Ltd grants an unlimited licence for the use of the content produced for its clients, along with behind-the-scenes content produced for the agency itself. This content can be used on the WebDevBuilders Ltd, YouTube channel, stock channels, social media platforms, or in emails to other clients. In the case where the content may be restricted or confidential, this should be flagged to the WebDevBuilders Ltd team before the completion of the project.

The price quoted excludes travel times in excess of one hour of driving. After this point, the client will be charged at a rate of €50 per hour until the shooting location is reached. The client will be made aware of such costs upfront to ensure price transparency.

Shoot times run from when the WebDevBuilders Ltd team arrive on site. It is expected that all parties are on time and organised to ensure an efficient shoot for all.

If a project needs to be cancelled or postponed, the client must give 48 hours of notice to WebDevBuilders Ltd to avoid a cancellation fee of €350. For projects in excess of €2000, WebDevBuilders Ltd require a deposit of 50% paid of the project’s VAT inclusive value.
